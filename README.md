### Description

This is a Windows NT netsend application. (This is my first submission!) This app Allows NT users to send messages across the network to single users, selected users, or a selected domain. The app allows users to store different netsend groups and allows the manual entry of a particular user to netsend.

This app was created from a base program called netsender that was downloaded from this site. I adding some of my own features and pieced together small chunks of code from various sources, then cleaned up the app, threw in correct tab stops, Alt keys etc.

Thanks to Many people for their contributions. Use it how you wish!
